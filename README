  GitBox - Git repository hosting inside a Dropbox folder
-----------------------------------------------------------

GitBox cross platform tool to host personal private git repositories inside
Dropbox folders that get automatically syncronised between operating systems,
machines and backed up on the internet.

Although everything the tool does can be done manually, the goal was to make
things simple and user friendly without having to remember a long list of git
commands and paths.


Sample Usage
------------

From computer A:
> gitbox create myapp
> gitbox clone myapp

// Do some work
> git add <some files>
> git commit -m "Commit message"
> git push gitbox

From computer B:
> gitbox clone myapp
// Do some work and push as previously

From computer A:
> git pull gitbox master
// Do some work
// .....

For a full list of supported commands check the user manual included both in the
installation and downloadable separately too from the project's download page:

I'd be grateful for testing on other distros and feedback on them. Also
implementing automatic installation of git would be fantastic.
